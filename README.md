Code supporting the manuscript: **Multiscale organisation of neuronal activity unifies scale-dependent theories of brain function**

**How to Iteratively coarse-grain your data:**
Run the code "ICG" on your time series. 

ICG will iteratively coarse-grain the time series by pairing variables by their Pearson correlation, then summing and repeating the procedure on the coarse-grained variables. 

It will output the coarse-grained variables across as many levels as possible and the original index of the variables.

**Extra code**
There is also code in the github for running the analysis (e.g., info theory, kurtosis, variance, timescales), network models, and various null models) specific to the paper.
