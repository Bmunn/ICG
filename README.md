Code supporting the manuscript: **Phylogenetically-Preserved Multiscale Neuronal Activity: Iterative Coarse-Graining Bridges Scale-Dependent Theories of Brain Function**

**Get started:**
To replicate the analysis, run the code "ICG" on your neuronal recordings.

Example data can be found here: (10.5281/zenodo.13283803)

There is also code for running the analysis (info theory, kurtosis, variance, timescales), network models, and various null models.
